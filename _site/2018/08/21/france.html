<p>The full name of France is the Republic of France.</p>

<p>Frank means "brave and free" in Germanic, which is the praise of the French ancestors in the Roman Empire. 
  France is the romantic center of Europe. With its long history, rich cultural connotation and rural scenery, 
  it attracts tourists from all over the world. Paris, the beautiful and charming blue coast, Provence in full bloom 
  with lavender and Bordeaux with fine wine are all fascinating tourist attractions.</p>
